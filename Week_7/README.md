# NTU_CSX_DataScience

## Progress
The 4th week progress is: Import data or use existing data, do data cleanning, preprocessing and then draw a word cloud.

## Course Practice
* Using R Crawler to download information on PTT
* Try to draw a word cloud
* But since I encountered a huge difficulty to deal with the nonsence characters caused by encoding or something, I have no HTML to show.

## Homework
Keywords from different media of Elon Musk
* Shiny.io: https://louiechen.shinyapps.io/Trial/
* However, the deployed Shiny.io can't read my data which is uploaded within the same file. The Shiny can only run on my computer, so I will demo it on class. Will try my best to figure out the reason by the end of this semester.
