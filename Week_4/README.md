## Progress
The third week progress is: Import data and draw plots.

## Course Practice
* Using R Crawler to download information on PTT
* Try to draw a word cloud
* But since I encountered a huge difficulty to deal with the nonsence characters caused by encoding or something, I have no HTML to show.
