# NTU_CSX_DataScience

## Progress
The 4th week progress is: Import data or use existing data, do data cleanning, preprocessing and then draw a word cloud.

## Course Practice
* Using R Crawler to download information on PTT
* Try to draw a word cloud
* But since I encountered a huge difficulty to deal with the nonsence characters caused by encoding or something, I have no HTML to show.

## Homework
* Drawing word cloud - using "I have a dream" speech text in English
